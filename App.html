	  <h3>Applications Of Biotechnology In Agriculture </h3>
													
      <p>
Biotechnology has many other useful applications besides those that are medically related. Many of these are in agriculture and food science. These include the development of transgenic crops - the placement of genes into plants to give the crop a beneficial trait. Benefits include:

<li>Improved yield from crops.</li>

<li>Reduced vulnerability of crops to environmental stresses.</li>

<li>Increased nutritional qualities of food crops.</li>

<li>Improved taste, texture or appearance of food.</li>

<li>Reduced dependence on fertilizers, pesticides and other agrochemicals.</li>

<li>Production of vaccines.</li> </p></div>
